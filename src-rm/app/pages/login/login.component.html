                        (iii) Enterprises want to be able to know the true performance colours of potential service providers and potential employees.
                        Colours means that potential services providers would have had to collect their own performance data into performance profile,
                        which they would have posted for viewing by potential Clients. The same capability means potential staff members would have
                        to over a period of time compiled their own performance profiles. In order to secure new jobs people would have had to publish
                        these performance profiles on Colours Marketplace. Clients and employers would then be able to view service providers and
                        potential staff members performance profiles. Naturally persons who want to find jobs would also want to publish their performance
                        profiles in order to secure employment.
